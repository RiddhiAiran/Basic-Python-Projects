## Code Explanation

The main logic is implemented in the `play_game` function:

1. **`clear_screen()`**: Clears the console for a seamless user experience.
2. **`typing(message, delay)`**: Simulates typing text with a delay.
3. **`hold_screen()`**: Pauses the screen until the user presses Enter.
4. **`get_user_name()`**: Prompts the user for their name and ensures it's valid.
5. **`get_user_choice()`**:
   - Prompts the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
   - Validates the input to ensure itâ€™s either 0, 1, or 2.
6. **`display_choices(user_choice, computer_choice, icons)`**:
   - Displays the choices made by the user and the computer using ASCII art.
7. **`determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`**:
   - Compares the choices and determines the winner of the round.
8. **`play_game()`**:
   - Manages the entire game flow, including score tracking, replay logic, and displaying results.
