## Code Explanation

The main logic is implemented in the `banker_roulette` function:

1. **`clear_screen()`**: Clears the console to provide a clean interface.
2. **`typing(message, delay)`**: Simulates typing text with a delay for enhanced engagement.
3. **`hold_screen()`**: Pauses the program until the user presses Enter.
4. **`banker_roulette()`**:
   - Prompts the user to enter participant names separated by commas.
   - Validates the input to ensure at least two participants are entered.
   - Uses the `random.choice()` function to select a random participant from the list.
   - Displays the chosen participant as the "banker."
