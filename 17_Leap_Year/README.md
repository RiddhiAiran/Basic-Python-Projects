# Leap Year Checker

Welcome to the **Leap Year Checker**! This program allows you to determine whether a given year is a leap year, following the standard leap year rules.

---

## Program Demo
Hereâ€™s an example of the Leap Year Checker in action:

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Interactive Input:** Prompts the user to enter a year to check.
- **Accurate Calculations:** Determines leap years using the standard rules.
- **Clear Outputs:** Displays a friendly and precise message indicating whether the year is a leap year.
- **Reusable Logic:** Modular design for easy integration or reuse in other projects.

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Used

This program demonstrates the following Python concepts:

1. **Conditional Statements:** Implements the logic for determining leap years.
2. **Loops:** Provides continuous user interaction until the user chooses to exit.
3. **Functions:** Encapsulates reusable logic for clear and concise code.
4. **Input Handling:** Dynamically accepts and processes user inputs.

## ðŸ“„ How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RiddhiAiran/Basic-Python-Projects.git
   cd 17_Leap_Year
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   Ensure Python is installed on your system. Execute the script using:
   ```bash
   python leap_year.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter the year you want to check.
   - Receive a clear output indicating whether it is a leap year.

## Code Explanation

### Main Functions

1. **`is_leap_year(year)`**:
   - Implements the leap year logic using nested conditionals.
   - Outputs a message stating whether the given year is a leap year.

2. **`main()`**:
   - Provides the program's entry point.
   - Manages user interaction and calls `is_leap_year()` based on inputs.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Want to check for Leap Year? (y/n): y
Enter the Year: 2000
2000 is a Leap Year.

Want to check for Leap Year? (y/n): y
Enter the Year: 1900
1900 is not a Leap Year.

Want to check for Leap Year? (y/n): n
Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹ See you next time.
```
