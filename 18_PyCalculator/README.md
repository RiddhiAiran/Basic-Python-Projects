# Python Calculator

Welcome to the **Python Calculator**! This interactive program performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to carry out continuous calculations seamlessly.

---

## Program Demo
Hereâ€™s how the Python Calculator works:

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Continuous Calculations:** Allows users to continue calculations using the result of the previous operation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Guides users with clear prompts and interactive input.

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Used

This program demonstrates the following Python concepts:

1. **Functions:** Implements separate functions for each arithmetic operation.
2. **Dictionaries:** Maps operators to their corresponding functions for streamlined logic.
3. **Loops and Conditionals:** Manages user input and allows continuous calculations.
4. **Dynamic Input Handling:** Handles numeric inputs interactively.

## ðŸ“„ How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RiddhiAiran/Basic-Python-Projects.git
   cd 18_PyCalculator
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   Ensure Python is installed on your system. Execute the script using:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter the first number and choose an operation.
   - Enter the next number to calculate and view the result.
   - Continue with the current result or start a new calculation.

## Code Explanation

### Main Functions

1. **Arithmetic Functions:**
   - `add(n1, n2)`
   - `subtract(n1, n2)`
   - `multiply(n1, n2)`
   - `divide(n1, n2)`

   Each function performs the corresponding operation and returns the result.

2. **`calc()`**:
   - Displays available operations.
   - Handles user input for numbers and operations.
   - Performs calculations and displays results.
   - Allows users to continue calculations with the current result or restart.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Welcome To Python Calculator!
Enter Your First Number: 10
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: +
Enter Your Next Number: 5
10 + 5 = 15
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: *
Enter Your Next Number: 2
15 * 2 = 30
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 30, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
Good Bye!
```
