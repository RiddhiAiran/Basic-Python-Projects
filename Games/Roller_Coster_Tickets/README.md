## ðŸ“„ How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RiddhiAiran/Basic-Python-Projects.git
   cd Games/Roller_Coster_Tickets
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Execute the script using:
   ```bash
   python roller_coster_tickets.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter your name and height.
   - Input your age to calculate the ride cost.
   - Choose whether you want a photo at the photo booth.
   - View the final bill and enjoy the ride!

## Code Explanation

The main logic is implemented in the `roller_coster_ride` function:

1. **`clear_screen()`**: Clears the console for a clean user experience.
2. **`typing(message, delay)`**: Simulates typing text with a delay.
3. **`hold_screen()`**: Pauses the screen until the user presses Enter.
4. **`roller_coster_ride()`**:
   - Prompts for user details: name, height, and age.
   - Checks if the height is sufficient to ride.
   - Calculates the ride cost based on age:
     - Under 12 years: $5
     - 12-17 years: $7
     - 18-35 years: $12
     - Over 35 years: Free ride.
   - Optionally adds $3 for a photo booth picture.
   - Displays the final bill.
5. **Loop for Multiple Rides:** The program keeps running until the user exits.
